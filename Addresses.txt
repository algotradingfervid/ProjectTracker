when I get a project i will create a BOQ and then I will create Bill from, Ship from, Bill to, Ship to and Install at address books for that project.
Bill from, Ship from, Bill to addresses are straight forward
Ship to and Install at can be same or can be different. 
when I get a project say which needs to be implemented in 1000 locations there are 2 scenarios that could happen
scenario 1: I need to ship to all these locations and send an installation team and install and commision at all the locations
Scenario 2: I will get a short list of addresses to ship to say 50 addresses for example, my responsibility is to deliver to this 50 locations, then the client would ship the equipment to all the 1000 locations from there, once the client completes the delivery I would send the installation teams to install and commision in all the 1000 locations to complete the project
in scenario 1, ship to and install at addresses are the same, but in scenario 2 we will have different set of addresses for ship to and install at with a one to many relationship between ship to> install at.
Based on this requirements I want to enhance this application to have 4 new tabs under the project details "Bill from, Ship from, Bill to, Ship to and Install at"
clearly understand the current project, and understand the design system here and 
create multi phased detailed implementation plans to implement this. there should be seperate plan file for each phase, make sure we have 15 + phases. use multiple agents to create thses plans
